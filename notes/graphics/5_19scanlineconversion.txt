Scanline Conversion

Basically in order to fill in a polygon, just draw lines to fill in the thing. Horizonal from bottom up to the top. There's no reason why you can't do vertical lines.

Call lines of triangle x0, x1, x1.
Find vertices. BMT



x0 will always be alone BT
x1 will be along BM if y < ym
MT if y > ym

First line drawn BB
(xb, yb) -> (xb, yb)
Second line
(xb + q, yb + 1)) ->(xb + r, yb + 1)
