/*We will expand our Warrior a little. Each Warrior will have a weapon. He is "born" with it, i.e. the weapon is created together with the warrior. It can only be accessed by him. It provides him with his strength. In battle, weapons lose their edge and weaken. When a Warrior's weapon loses all of its strength, the Warrior himself dies.*/
